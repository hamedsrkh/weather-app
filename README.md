## Description üìã

This assignment involves creating a web application that provides information about Weather condition using technologies such as Nextjs, Styled-component, TypeScript, and more. The application allows users to view weather specific data for their how city and some other cities around the world.

You can check out the final implementation of this app on this URL hosted on Vercel.

## How to Run üöÄ

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and configure any necessary environment variables.
4. Run the following commands to start the application:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## In a Better World üåç

In an ideal scenario, several improvements and enhancements could be made to this application, including:

- Test Coverage: Covering the entire application with a comprehensive set of tests to ensure stability and reliability.
- Add more custom hooks: Implementing weather fetch and city change logic in a custom hook to have a more professional and cleaner code.
- Enhancing User Interface: Improving the user interface for a more polished and user-friendly experience.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for automating the build and deployment process. This would streamline the development workflow and ensure reliable deployments.

## Technologies

The assignment uses the following technologies and tools:

- Next.js: Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple configuration. It provides a seamless way to build React applications with efficient routing and is often used for building modern web applications and websites.

- Typescript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It enhances the development experience by catching type-related errors during compile-time, making the codebase more robust and easier to maintain, especially in larger projects.

- Styled-components: Styled-components is a library for styling React components with tagged template literals. It allows developers to write CSS directly within their JavaScript code, creating scoped and reusable styles for components. This approach provides better control over styling in React applications and encourages the use of component-based styles.
